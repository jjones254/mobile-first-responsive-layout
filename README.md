## Mobile First Responsive Layout ##
 
### Project Instructions ###

* [X] Create your file structure:
  * Create an index.html and styles.css file.
  * Create a folder called `css` and put your styles.css file inside of it. The name of the folder should not be capitalized.
  * Link the styles.css file to index.html

* [X] Build the layout using a mobile first design:
  * Look at the provided mockup for the mobile device and add the same header, titles, content and footer information into your index.html file.
  * Use the provided images for the portfolio gallery images shown in the mockups.
  * Use a font from Google Fonts for the text.
  * Use CSS to style your layout to match the provided mobile mockup. Make sure your mobile design matches the mockup at 320px screen size.

* [X] Once you have everything in place for the mobile layout, use media queries to add breakpoints to adjust the layout for wider tablet and desktop screens.
  * Match the design as it should look on a tablet device that is 768px wide and a desktop screen size that is 1024px wide.
  * Use a mobile-first approach by writing your media queries using the `min-width` property in your CSS.

* [X] Once all your breakpoints are in place, double check your layout matches the three mockups.
  * The design does not need to be exact, but the general spacing and arrangement of the elements should match the design of the mockups for mobile, tablet and desktop.
  * Feel free to replace the profile image and customize the text, but the layouts should match the mockups.

* [X] Link your navigation menu to the correct sections of the page using IDs to link to anchor tags. See this video on Linking to Sections of a Web Page.
